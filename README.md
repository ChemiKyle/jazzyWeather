# jazzyWeather
Two of my favorite things are waking up with a worryingly small amount of time to get ready and jazz. I occasionally have slow networking on my cell phone, but that's not one of my favorite things.


I've lived in quite a few places with somewhat unpredictable weather, so I made this small program to play a song as my alarm, the song chosen depends on the chance of precipitation and the season, so that Pavlovian conditioning will lead me to grab a rain coat while I'm rushing out the door to barely make the bus.  
Salivation not included.

## I don't care about your life story, what's it do? 
Play a different song according to the weather and (optionally) the season.  
Place desired music files in subdirectories for "clear/", "rain/", and "snow/" conditions (also needed in each season directory if using the seasons).

TODO:  
  Write a bash script that runs the python script at the time for the alarm  
  Conjure up some way to slowly raise the volume, like Android's smart alarm
