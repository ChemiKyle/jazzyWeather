# jazzyWeather
Play a different song according to the season and the weather.

Two of my favorite things are waking up with a worryingly small amount of time to get ready and jazz. I occasionally have slow networking on my cell phone, but that's not one of my favorite things.


I've lived in quite a few places with somewhat unpredictable weather, so I made this small program to play a song as my alarm, the song chosen depends on the chance of precipitation and the season, so that Pavlovian conditioning will let me know whether or not to grab a rain coat while I'm rushing out the door to barely make the bus.  
Salivation not included.
